<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Circulatory Support Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assisted Device (VAD)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart (TAH)</li><li>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The circulatory support devices market comprises three main types: Ventricular Assisted Devices (VADs), Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs), and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). VADs assist heart function by pumping blood for weakened ventricles, while TAHs replace both heart ventricles in patients with end-stage heart failure. ECMO provides temporary cardiac and pulmonary support by oxygenating blood outside the body, making it essential for critically ill patients. Together, these devices enhance patient outcomes in advanced heart disease management.</p></p>
