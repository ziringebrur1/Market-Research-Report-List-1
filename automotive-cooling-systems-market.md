<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive cooling systems market is primarily divided into two types: liquid-cooled and air-cooled systems. Liquid-cooled systems use coolant fluid circulated through pipes and a radiator to efficiently transfer heat away from the engine, ensuring optimal operating temperatures. In contrast, air-cooled systems rely on air flow and fins to dissipate heat directly from the engine, making them simpler and lighter but less effective in extreme conditions. Each type is chosen based on vehicle design, performance needs, and climate conditions.</p></p>
